### Objective

The project's primary goal is to examine an advanced machine learning technique that employs clustering in order to analyze data structures and as a preparation tool for forecasting whether a patient has diabetes,
based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. The particular aim is to determine if integrating cluster labels to models for classification as fresh data inputs can improve accuracy for prediction.

### Dataset

The diabetes dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaydattatraykhare/diabetes-dataset) contains the following key features:
- Pregnancies: To express the Number of pregnancies
- Glucose: To express the Glucose level in blood
- BloodPressure: To express the Blood pressure measurement
- SkinThickness: To express the thickness of the skin
- Insulin: To express the Insulin level in blood
- BMI: To express the Body mass index
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: To express the Diabetes percentage
- Age: To express the age
- Outcome: To express the final result 1 is Yes and 0 is No
